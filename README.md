<h1 align='center'> One-Commander-Paper-Theme</h1>

![](https://i.imgur.com/JOrCYqp.png)

A theme for [one commander](http://www.onecommander.com) app.
 
Based on [Paper theme by niivu](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Paper-for-Windows-10-881587608) color palette...
 
Actually, I just recolored "dark theme by Milos Paripovic" to match this theme color palette...
